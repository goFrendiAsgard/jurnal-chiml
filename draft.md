# Abstract

Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) has been proven to be quite effective to deal with software complexity. Nowadays developers prefer to build micro-services rather than single monolithic application. Several SOA approaches like HTTP/REST API, GraphQL, and BPEL are commonly used by developers. Some of those solutions are built under assumptions that the developers are either building the services from scratch or able to create abstraction layer for the pre-existing services. In most cases the assumptions are true. However there are cases when developers prefer to keep the architecture as simple as possible without any need to build additional abstraction layers. For example, when they work with mini-embeded system.

Previously, a YAML based orchestration language was developed for Chimera-Framework (A language agnostic framework for stand-alone and distributed computing). In this paper, we refine the orchestration language in order to let developers accessing pre-existing services without any need to build another abstraction layer.
