# Abstract

Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) has been proven to be quite effective to deal with software complexity. Nowadays developers prefer to build micro-services rather than single monolithic application. Several SOA approaches like REST API, GraphQL, and BPEL are commonly used by developers. However, those mechanism heavily rely on web services. Although this dependency is quite normal in any modern achitecture, a simpler mechanism with less dependency is still expected. Especially in a stand-alone machine. Previously, a YAML based orchestration language was developed for Chimera-Framework (A language agnostic framework for stand-alone and distributed computing). In this paper, we refine the orchestration language to make it more readable and more compact.
